# Product Context

## Problem Solved

Managing payments across multiple processors can be complex, requiring businesses to interact with various dashboards and APIs. This leads to operational inefficiencies, difficulty in getting a unified view of payments, and challenges in optimizing payment routing and costs. The Hyperswitch Control Center addresses this by providing a single, open-source interface to view, manage, and control all payment operations through Hyperswitch, simplifying payment management and offering tools for optimization and analytics.
