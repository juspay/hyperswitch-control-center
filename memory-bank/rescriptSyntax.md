# ReScript Syntax Reminders

This file contains specific reminders about ReScript syntax, particularly within JSX for React components.

## JSX `key` Prop with `int` to `string` Conversion

- When using an integer as the key in a list of JSX elements and needing to convert it to a string, the correct ReScript syntax is to use `Int.toString`. This conversion should be enclosed within curly braces `{}` as it's a ReScript expression within JSX.

- **Incorrect:**
  ```rescript
  <div key={index->Int.toString()} className="col-span-4">
    <AuthenticationInput index allowEdit isDisabled />
  </div>
  ```
````

_(Note: The `->` operator is not the standard way to call `toString` on an `int` in ReScript.)_

- **Correct:**
  ```rescript
  <div key={Int.toString(index)} className="col-span-4">
    <AuthenticationInput index allowEdit isDisabled />
  </div>
  ```
  or
  ```rescript
  <div key={`$index`} className="col-span-4">
    <AuthenticationInput index allowEdit isDisabled />
  </div>
  ```
  _(Using string interpolation is often a cleaner way to convert to a string in this context.)_

## Passing Boolean Expressions as Props

- When passing a boolean expression (e.g., using the `!` not operator) directly as the value of a prop in a ReScript JSX element, it **must** be enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

- **Incorrect:**

  ```rescript
  <MyComponent isDisabled=someBooleanVariable />
  <SubmitButton disabledParamter=!allowEdit />
  ```

- **Correct:**

  ```rescript
  <MyComponent isDisabled={someBooleanVariable} />
  <SubmitButton disabledParamter={!allowEdit} />
  ```

- **Explanation:** Curly braces `{}` in JSX indicate that the content within is a ReScript expression that needs to be evaluated. Without them, the value might be interpreted as a string literal.

## Prop Passing for Function Calls and Chained Operations

- When passing the result of a function call or a chain of operations (using `->`) as a prop to a React component in ReScript JSX, ensure it is enclosed in curly braces `{}`. This is consistent with how dynamic values are embedded within JSX.

- **Example (Function Call):** Instead of `<MyComponent someProp=myFunction() />`, use `<MyComponent someProp={myFunction()} />`.

- **Example (Chained Operation):** Instead of `<MyComponent data=someValue->processA->processB />`, use `<MyComponent data={someValue->processA->processB} />`.

## Object Literals as Props

- When passing ReScript records (similar to JavaScript object literals) as props, especially for configuration or initial data, ensure they are enclosed in curly braces `{}`.

- **Example:** Instead of `<FormComponent initialValues={name: "", age: 0} />`, use `<FormComponent initialValues={{name: "", age: 0}} />`.

**To create this `rescriptSyntax.md` file:**

1.  Open a plain text editor.
2.  Copy and paste the Markdown content above into the editor.
3.  Save the file as `rescriptSyntax.md`.

This file now focuses specifically on ReScript syntax reminders related to JSX prop passing and the `key` prop. Let me know if you have any other syntax points you'd like to include!

## ReScript JSX: Wrapping `makeFieldInfo` Calls as Props

When using the output of a function like `makeFieldInfo` directly as a prop value in a ReScript JSX component, you need to ensure it's enclosed within curly braces `{}`. This tells JSX to evaluate the ReScript expression and use its result as the prop's value.

**Error Example:**

```rescript
<FieldRenderer
  field={
    makeFieldInfo(
      ~name="someName",
      ~label="Some Label",
      // ... other arguments ...
    )
  }
/>
````

## ReScript JSX: Wrapping Chained Operations as Props

When passing the result of a chain of operations using the pipe-forward operator (`->`) as a prop in ReScript JSX, the entire chain needs to be enclosed within curly braces `{}`. This ensures that the entire expression is evaluated before its result is passed as the prop's value.

**Error Example:**

```rescript
<FieldRenderer
  field=someList
  ->Array.map(item => processItem(item))
  ->filter(isValid)
  errorClass
  // ... other props
/>
```

```rescript
<FieldRenderer
  field={someList
  ->Array.map(item => processItem(item))
  ->filter(isValid)}
  errorClass
  // ... other props
/>
```
