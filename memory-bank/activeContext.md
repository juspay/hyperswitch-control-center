# Active Context: ReScript Syntax Guide Completion

## 1. Current Work:

The primary focus of the current session was the review, augmentation, and finalization of the **ReScript Syntax Guide** within the Memory Bank. This involved:

- **Review and Refinement:**
  - Updating the main index file (`memory-bank/rescriptSyntaxGuide.md`) to accurately reflect populated content.
  - Deleting the redundant `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/jsxSyntax.md` file after content migration.
- **Broader Code Scan & Augmentation:**
  - Scanning the `src/` directory for diverse examples of ReScript syntax.
  - Augmenting the following syntax documents with new, codebase-specific examples:
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/typesAndDataStructures.md`: Added more examples of polymorphic variants, including those with payloads.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/patternMatching.md`: Added a new section on matching polymorphic variants with examples.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/functionsAndBindings.md`: Added further examples of the pipe operator and a codebase-specific example for `let rec`.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/jsInterop.md`: Updated with specific codebase examples for various `@bs.*` attributes (`@bs.val`, `@bs.module`, `@bs.send`, `@bs.get`, `@bs.set`, `@bs.new`, `@obj`) and `"%identity"`.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/commonStdLib.md`: Added examples for `Belt.Float.toString`, `Belt.Int.toString`, and `Belt.Array.zipBy`.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/modules.md`: Replaced generic nested module example with specific examples from `src/components/Tabs.res`.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/jsxPatterns.md`: Reviewed and deemed sufficiently detailed from previous work.
- **Overall Goal:** To create a comprehensive and practical ReScript syntax reference based on patterns observed in the Hyperswitch Control Center codebase.

## 2. Key Technical Concepts Covered in the Guide:

- **ReScript Syntax Categories Documented:**
  - JSX Patterns (prop handling, conditional rendering, list rendering, fragments, etc.)
  - Modules and File Structure (file-based modules, `.resi` interfaces, `open` statements, nested modules).
  - Types and Data Structures (variants, records, polymorphic variants, `option`, `array`, `list`, `Js.Dict.t`, type aliases).
  - Pattern Matching (`switch` on variants, options, polymorphic variants, lists, booleans).
  - Functions and Let Bindings (definitions, labeled/optional arguments, pipe operator, recursion).
  - JavaScript Interoperability (`%raw`, `external`, `@bs.*` attributes, `Js.Promise.t`, `Js.Nullable.t`).
  - Common Standard Library Usage (`Js.*` modules, `Belt.*` modules).
- **Memory Bank Management:** Structuring documentation, creating index files, managing thematic subfolders.

## 3. Relevant Files and Code (Syntax Guide Documents):

- **Main Index:** `memory-bank/rescriptSyntaxGuide.md`
- **Thematic Subdirectory:** `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/`
  - `jsxPatterns.md`
  - `modules.md`
  - `typesAndDataStructures.md`
  - `patternMatching.md`
  - `functionsAndBindings.md`
  - `jsInterop.md`
  - `commonStdLib.md`
- **Supporting Files (Analyzed for Examples):** Various files within `src/` including components, utilities, and API handling logic.

## 4. Problem Solving / Observations:

- The `search_files` tool occasionally had difficulty with certain regex patterns or specific files (e.g., initially failing to find nested module definitions that were confirmed by reading the file). Workaround involved manual file inspection or regex refinement.
- Distinguishing polymorphic variants from template strings using regex was challenging due to the overloaded backtick character; searches were refined to target type definitions or specific usage patterns.

## 5. Pending Tasks and Next Steps:

- The ReScript Syntax Guide is now considered complete for this iteration.
- The next step is to update `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect this milestone.
- Future work could involve adding even more advanced ReScript patterns or examples as they are encountered or deemed necessary.
