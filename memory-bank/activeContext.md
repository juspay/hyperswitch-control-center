# Active Context: Ongoing Development

## 1. Current Work:

The current work involves ongoing development across various modules and components. Recent activity includes:

- **AuthModule/ProductSelection:**
  - Modifications to `src/entryPoints/AuthModule/ProductSelection/ProductSelectionProvider.res` related to product selection logic.
- **Recoils:**
  - Updates to `src/Recoils/TableAtoms.res` for managing table state using Recoil.
- **Sidebar:**
  - Modifications to `src/entryPoints/SidebarValues.res` related to sidebar values and navigation.
- **Revenue Recovery:**
  - Development of `src/RevenueRecovery/RevenueRecoveryScreens/RevenueRecoveryOverview/RevenueRecoveryOverview.res` for the Revenue Recovery overview screen.
- **Customers:**
  - Updates to `src/screens/Customers/Customers.res` and `src/screens/Customers/CustomersEntity.res` related to customer management.
- **Routing:**
  - Modifications to `src/screens/Routing/HistoryEntity.res` related to routing history.
- **Transaction Disputes:**
  - Updates to `src/screens/Transaction/Disputes/DisputesEntity.res` related to transaction disputes.
- **Review and Refinement:**
  - Updating the main index file (`memory-bank/rescriptSyntaxGuide.md`) to accurately reflect populated content.
  - Deleting the redundant `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/jsxSyntax.md` file after content migration.
- **Broader Code Scan & Augmentation:**
  - Scanning the `src/` directory for diverse examples of ReScript syntax.
  - Augmenting the following syntax documents with new, codebase-specific examples:
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/typesAndDataStructures.md`: Added more examples of polymorphic variants, including those with payloads.
- **Context7 MCP Server Setup:**
  - Successfully installed and configured the `github.com/upstash/context7-mcp` server.
  - Installation involved creating a Dockerfile and building a Docker image, as initial attempts with `npx`, `bunx`, and `deno` were unsuccessful.
  - The server's `resolve-library-id` tool was tested successfully for "react" and "rescript".
  - The server is now available for fetching up-to-date library documentation.
  - MCP settings file (`/Users/jeeva.ramachandran/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`) was updated with the Docker configuration:
    ```json
    "github.com/upstash/context7-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "context7-mcp"],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
    ```
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/patternMatching.md`: Added a new section on matching polymorphic variants with examples.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/functionsAndBindings.md`: Added further examples of the pipe operator and a codebase-specific example for `let rec`.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/jsInterop.md`: Updated with specific codebase examples for various `@bs.*` attributes (`@bs.val`, `@bs.module`, `@bs.send`, `@bs.get`, `@bs.set`, `@bs.new`, `@obj`) and `"%identity"`.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/commonStdLib.md`: Added examples for `Belt.Float.toString`, `Belt.Int.toString`, and `Belt.Array.zipBy`.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/modules.md`: Replaced generic nested module example with specific examples from `src/components/Tabs.res`.
    - `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/syntax/jsxPatterns.md`: Reviewed and deemed sufficiently detailed from previous work.
- **Overall Goal:** To create a comprehensive and practical ReScript syntax reference based on patterns observed in the Hyperswitch Control Center codebase.
- **Memory Bank Enhancement (TestComponent Learnings):** Updating the guide `memory-bank/thematic/TableComponentPage/creatingNewTablePage.md` with troubleshooting tips and corrections (e.g., `Table.header` type, `itemToObjMapper` signature, module routing references) derived from the recent `TestComponent` page implementation.

## 2. Key Technical Concepts:

- **ReScript and React:** Continued use of ReScript and React for building UI components.
- **Recoil:** Utilizing Recoil for managing global application state.
- **Modular Architecture:** Maintaining a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- **Feature Flags:** Using feature flags to enable/disable functionalities.

## 3. Relevant Files and Code:

- `src/entryPoints/AuthModule/ProductSelection/ProductSelectionProvider.res`
- `src/Recoils/TableAtoms.res`
- `src/entryPoints/SidebarValues.res`
- `src/RevenueRecovery/RevenueRecoveryScreens/RevenueRecoveryOverview/RevenueRecoveryOverview.res`
- `src/screens/Customers/Customers.res`
- `src/screens/Customers/CustomersEntity.res`
- `src/screens/Routing/HistoryEntity.res`
- `src/screens/Transaction/Disputes/DisputesEntity.res`

## 4. Problem Solving / Observations:

- (To be updated with any specific problem-solving efforts or observations)

## 5. Pending Tasks and Next Steps:

- Continue development on the Revenue Recovery module.
- Further refine the customer management screens.
- Address any issues related to routing history and transaction disputes.
- The guide `memory-bank/thematic/TableComponentPage/creatingNewTablePage.md` has been enhanced with troubleshooting tips from the `TestComponent` implementation.
- The ReScript Syntax Guide is considered complete for its recent iteration and has been reorganized.
- The Context7 MCP server (`github.com/upstash/context7-mcp`) is installed and available (details in `techContext.md` and `progress.md`).
- Future work could involve adding even more advanced ReScript patterns or examples as they are encountered or deemed necessary.
