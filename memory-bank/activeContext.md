# Active Context: Memory Bank Update (2025-05-14)

## 1. Current Work:

The current focus is on adding a new PayoutProcessor connector named `payoutTestConnector`.

**Details:**
- Connector Name: `payoutTestConnector`
- Description: `this is a test connector`
- Connector Type: `PayoutProcessor`
- ReScript Variant: `PAYOUTTESTCONNECTOR`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/screens/Connectors/ConnectorTypes.res`: Added `PAYOUTTESTCONNECTOR` to `payoutProcessorTypes`.
- `src/screens/Connectors/ConnectorUtils.res`:
    - Added `PayoutProcessor(PAYOUTTESTCONNECTOR)` to `payoutConnectorList`.
    - Added `payoutTestConnectorInfo` definition.
    - Updated `getPayoutProcessorNameString` to include `PAYOUTTESTCONNECTOR`.
    - Updated `getConnectorNameTypeFromString` for `PayoutProcessor` to include `payouttestconnector`.
    - Updated `getPayoutProcessorInfo` to include `PAYOUTTESTCONNECTOR`.
    - Updated `getDisplayNameForPayoutProcessor` to include `PAYOUTTESTCONNECTOR`.

## 2. Key Technical Concepts:

- ReScript variant definitions and usage.
- Connector configuration patterns in Hyperswitch Control Center.
- Modifying utility functions for connector information retrieval.

## 3. Relevant Files and Code:

- `src/screens/Connectors/ConnectorTypes.res`
- `src/screens/Connectors/ConnectorUtils.res`
- `src/screens/Connectors/PayoutProcessor/PayoutProcessorList.res` (Reviewed, no direct changes needed for this task)

## 4. Problem Solving / Observations (Ongoing):

- Encountered a ReScript compiler error initially after modifying `ConnectorUtils.res` regarding the new type variant. This was likely due to the compiler not immediately picking up the change from `ConnectorTypes.res` or a temporary inconsistency during multi-step file modification. The issue seems to have resolved as subsequent modifications were applied.

## 5. Pending Tasks and Next Steps:

1.  Confirm successful compilation and test the new connector integration in the UI (if possible/applicable through a running instance).
2.  Update `memory-bank/progress.md` to log the addition of this connector.
3.  Conclude the task of adding the new connector.
4.  Documented the steps for adding a new connector in `memory-bank/thematic/connectors/adding-new-connector.md`.
