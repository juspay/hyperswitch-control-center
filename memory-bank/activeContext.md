# Active Context: Ongoing Development

## 1. Current Work:

The current work involves ongoing development across various modules and components. Recent activity includes:

- **AuthModule/ProductSelection:**
  - Modifications to `src/entryPoints/AuthModule/ProductSelection/ProductSelectionProvider.res` related to product selection logic.
- **Recoils:**
  - Updates to `src/Recoils/TableAtoms.res` for managing table state using Recoil.
- **Sidebar:**
  - Modifications to `src/entryPoints/SidebarValues.res` related to sidebar values and navigation.
- **Revenue Recovery:**
  - Development of `src/RevenueRecovery/RevenueRecoveryScreens/RevenueRecoveryOverview/RevenueRecoveryOverview.res` for the Revenue Recovery overview screen.
- **Customers:**
  - Updates to `src/screens/Customers/Customers.res` and `src/screens/Customers/CustomersEntity.res` related to customer management.
- **Routing:**
  - Modifications to `src/screens/Routing/HistoryEntity.res` related to routing history.
- **Transaction Disputes:**
  - Updates to `src/screens/Transaction/Disputes/DisputesEntity.res` related to transaction disputes.

## 2. Key Technical Concepts:

- **ReScript and React:** Continued use of ReScript and React for building UI components.
- **Recoil:** Utilizing Recoil for managing global application state.
- **Modular Architecture:** Maintaining a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- **Feature Flags:** Using feature flags to enable/disable functionalities.

## 3. Relevant Files and Code:

- `src/entryPoints/AuthModule/ProductSelection/ProductSelectionProvider.res`
- `src/Recoils/TableAtoms.res`
- `src/entryPoints/SidebarValues.res`
- `src/RevenueRecovery/RevenueRecoveryScreens/RevenueRecoveryOverview/RevenueRecoveryOverview.res`

## 4. Problem Solving / Observations:

- (To be updated with any specific problem-solving efforts or observations)

## 5. Pending Tasks and Next Steps:

- Continue development on the Revenue Recovery module.
- Further refine the customer management screens.
- Address any issues related to routing history and transaction disputes.
- Created a memory bank under thematic for the task completed step by step so that I can use it later as a reference when we need to make a table in `memory-bank/thematic/table/tableCreation.md`.
- Updated the following memory bank files: `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`, `memory-bank/productContext.md`, `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`, `memory-bank/techContext.md`, and `memory-bank/progress.md`.
