# Project Progress

## Current Status

- Context7 MCP Server (`github.com/upstash/context7-mcp`) successfully installed and configured via Docker (as of 2025-05-15). This server provides tools for fetching up-to-date library documentation.
- Memory Bank review and update cycle completed (as of 2025-05-14). Redundant files archived, content consolidated.
- ReScript Syntax Guide in Memory Bank completed and populated with codebase examples (as of 2025-05-13).
  (To be updated regularly by the project team. Example: "Actively in development, focusing on feature X. Last major release: v0.5.0 on YYYY-MM-DD")

## Project Evolution & Key Decisions

- 2025-05-15: Installed and configured the Context7 MCP Server (`github.com/upstash/context7-mcp`) using Docker. This provides access to tools for fetching current library documentation, enhancing development efficiency. The installation process involved troubleshooting various command-line runner options before successfully using Docker.
- 2025-05-14: Added new PayoutProcessor `payoutTestConnector`. Modified `ConnectorTypes.res` and `ConnectorUtils.res` to include the new connector variant, its information, and mappings in relevant utility functions. Also documented the steps for adding a new connector in `memory-bank/thematic/connectors/adding-new-connector.md`.
- 2025-05-14: Performed a comprehensive Memory Bank update. This involved reviewing all core and thematic documents, archiving outdated/redundant files (`architecture.md`, `dependencies.md`, `local-setup.md`, `systemOverview.md`, `systemPatterns/coding-conventions.md`), and consolidating information (e.g., local setup details merged into `techContext.md`, coding conventions added to `techContext.md`).
- 2025-05-13: Created a comprehensive ReScript syntax guide within the Memory Bank to document common patterns and best practices observed in the codebase.
  (To be updated by the project team. Log significant architectural changes, major feature additions/removals, or strategic pivots. Example:)
- YYYY-MM-DD: Decided to switch state management from Context API to Recoil for better scalability.
- YYYY-MM-DD: Added support for Processor ABC based on community demand.
