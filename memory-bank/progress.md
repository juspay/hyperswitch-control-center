## Project Evolution & Key Decisions

- 2025-05-15: Updated `activeContext.md` to reflect ongoing development activities across various modules and components.
- 2025-05-14: Added new PayoutProcessor `payoutTestConnector`. Modified `ConnectorTypes.res` and `ConnectorUtils.res` to include the new connector variant, its information, and mappings in relevant utility functions. Also documented the steps for adding a new connector in `memory-bank/thematic/connectors/adding-new-connector.md`.
- 2025-05-14: Performed a comprehensive Memory Bank update. This involved reviewing all core and thematic documents, archiving outdated/redundant files (`architecture.md`, `dependencies.md`, `local-setup.md`, `systemOverview.md`, `systemPatterns/coding-conventions.md`), and consolidating information (e.g., local setup details merged into `techContext.md`, coding conventions added to `techContext.md`).
- 2025-05-13: Created a comprehensive ReScript syntax guide within the Memory Bank to document common patterns and best practices observed in the codebase.
- 2025-05-15: Created a new component with API integration and table display. Added a link to the new component in the sidebar. The component fetches data from the `/testing_data` endpoint and displays it in a table. Refactored the new files created and for data conversion use `'src/utils/LogicUtils.res'` and created a new atom in `TableAtoms.res` and updated the component to use it.
