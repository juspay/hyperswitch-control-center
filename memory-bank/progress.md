## Key Performance Indicators

### System Performance
- Dashboard initial load time: Target < 3 seconds
- Payment operation response time: Target < 1 second
- Analytics rendering performance: Optimization ongoing for large datasets

### User Adoption
- Tracking through feature usage analytics
- Gathering feedback through in-app mechanisms when enabled

### Technical Health
- ReScript compilation ensures type safety
- Automated testing through Cypress
- Continuous integration for build validation

## Known Limitations

1. **Scale Limitations**
   - Large volume payment processing may experience performance degradation
   - Analytics visualizations may be slow with very large datasets

2. **Browser Support**
   - Optimized for modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
   - Limited support for older browsers

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - Primary design focus is desktop-first for complex operations
   - Mobile experience optimized for monitoring rather than configuration

## Integration Status

| Integration | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Stripe | Complete | Full integration with all major features |
| Braintree | Complete | Full integration with all major features |
| Adyen | Complete | Full integration with all major features |
| PayPal | Complete | Special onboarding workflow implemented |
| Other Processors | Ongoing | New integrations added regularly |

## Technical Debt Status

The project maintains a conscious approach to technical debt:

1. **Actively Managing**
   - API response handling standardization
   - Component prop interfaces
   - Error recovery mechanisms

2. **Scheduled for Addressing**
   - Legacy state management patterns
   - Inconsistent styling patterns in older components
   - Test coverage gaps

3. **Accepted Debt**
   - Some duplication in utility functions for performance reasons
   - Backward compatibility requirements for older API versions
