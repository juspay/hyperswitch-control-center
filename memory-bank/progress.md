## Technical Debt Status

The project maintains a structured approach to technical debt management:

1. **Recently Addressed**

   - API response handling standardization with typed responses
   - Component prop interfaces with comprehensive .resi files
   - Error recovery mechanisms with PageLoaderWrapper pattern
   - Consolidated styling patterns using Tailwind utility classes

2. **Currently Addressing**

   - Legacy state management patterns being migrated to Recoil atoms
   - Improving test coverage for core components and utilities
   - Refactoring older components to follow current patterns
   - Optimizing API fetch patterns with cancellation support

3. **Scheduled for Next Sprint**

   - Code splitting optimization for better bundle size
   - Enhanced documentation for component usage patterns
   - Performance optimizations for complex data visualizations
   - Accessibility improvements for interactive components

4. **Accepted Debt**
   - Strategic duplication in critical utility functions for performance
   - Backward compatibility support for legacy API versions
   - Some UI inconsistencies in rarely used administrative interfaces

- 2025-05-16 (Afternoon): Enhanced the `memory-bank/thematic/TableComponentPage/creatingNewTablePage.md` guide by adding a "Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting / Key Learnings" section. This new section includes detailed explanations and solutions for issues related to `Table.header` type usage, `itemToObjMapper` signature with `LogicUtils.getArrayDataFromJson`, and correct module referencing in routes, based on learnings from the `TestComponent` page implementation.
- 2025-05-16: Conducted Memory Bank consistency review and update. Key changes include:
  - Updated `systemPatterns.md` to remove a redundant link to archived coding conventions, as this information is now in `techContext.md`.
  - Corrected a path typo in `activeContext.md` related to the table creation guide.
  - Reorganized ReScript syntax documentation: moved `rescriptSyntaxGuide.md` to `memory-bank/thematic/rescript/index.md` and updated links in `techContext.md` and within the guide itself.
  - Updated `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` to reflect the completion of this review cycle.
- 2025-05-15: Updated `activeContext.md` to reflect ongoing development activities across various modules and components.
- 2025-05-15: Installed and configured the Context7 MCP Server (`github.com/upstash/context7-mcp`) using Docker. This provides access to tools for fetching current library documentation, enhancing development efficiency. The installation process involved troubleshooting various command-line runner options before successfully using Docker.
- 2025-05-14: Added new PayoutProcessor `payoutTestConnector`. Modified `ConnectorTypes.res` and `ConnectorUtils.res` to include the new connector variant, its information, and mappings in relevant utility functions. Also documented the steps for adding a new connector in `memory-bank/thematic/connectors/adding-new-connector.md`.
- 2025-05-14: Performed a comprehensive Memory Bank update. This involved reviewing all core and thematic documents, archiving outdated/redundant files (`architecture.md`, `dependencies.md`, `local-setup.md`, `systemOverview.md`, `systemPatterns/coding-conventions.md`), and consolidating information (e.g., local setup details merged into `techContext.md`, coding conventions added to `techContext.md`).
- 2025-05-13: Created a comprehensive ReScript syntax guide within the Memory Bank to document common patterns and best practices observed in the codebase.
- 2025-05-15: Created a new component with API integration and table display. Added a link to the new component in the sidebar. The component fetches data from the `/testing_data` endpoint and displays it in a table. Refactored the new files created and for data conversion use `'src/utils/LogicUtils.res'` and created a new atom in `TableAtoms.res` and updated the component to use it.
